This is a set of 10 small introductory C-SDL programs.  
It's about the window, the window icon and surfaces.  
And it shows why SDL_Renderer Infrastructure is so useful.  

* 1 - shows how to init Video/Events and create the first Window
* 2 - use window icon
* 2a- use custom pointer
* 3 - initializes the screen with the color we want
* 4 - switches 2 colors time-based
* 5 - draws a circle
* 5a- uses [SDL_BlitSurface](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_BlitSurface) to show SDL Logo.  
* 5b- flipping surfaces with own functions  
* 6 - draws an RGB gradient
* 7 - draws an RGB gradient on a resizeable window
* 8 - animates the gradient time-based and function timing is done to see why we want the SDL_Renderer
